# uClassManagers
The module that will ultimately expand uScript2.

# Note
Documentation soon, I promise.

# Wtf does it contain?
More classes introduced
Extra methods for existing classes
Unturned's `static` managers (VehicleManager, ItemManager, etc.)

# Extra info
I've worked on this for the sole purpose of expanding uScript2.
Many people wonder "Where is x? You should add x."
I'm free to add suggestions here, if you want something to be added here, make an issue with the tag Suggestion.

# P.S
I'm not the developer of uScript2, it's @strlng.
I can't add syntax, or add more C# syntax (like LINQ) into uScript2.

If you have any one of those, I recommend removing it. Not hating, but these are already exists in uClassManagers and to prevent method conflict, you need to uninstall it.
